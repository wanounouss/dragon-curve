# dragon-curve

Dragon curves are awesome fractal structures, which you can create by simply folding a strip of paper many times in the same direction. Unfolding the strip leaves corners which produce a mesmerizing repeating structure: the dragon curve.

Because folding paper strips many many times is hard and requires a lot of paper, I provide here a small Python code which emulates the folding process, allowing us to observe the beautifull patterns it leads to.

Incidently, I used one of the produced graph as the new year greeting card I sent to family and friends.
